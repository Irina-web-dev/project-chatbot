# Technigo cinema chatbot

Our project for this week was to work with pair programming and build a chatbot by using the basics of Javascript, which has been the focus during the lectures this week.

## The problem

We decided to create a chatbot where the user can order tickets for the cinema, after making several choices.
On the first day, we decided on the idea for the project, and we also created all the content, so that we had that part ready and could focus only on code for the rest of the week. That turned out to be a good approach which really did speed up the work for the remaining days.

We used Visual Studio Code Live Share in order to be able to pair program which worked well for us. We met on Zoom for a few hours most days of the week, and worked on the code together. Some evenings we also made a few smaller updates separately, but always made sure that both approved and understood what had been done.

We started with the greeting and created one question at a time, and made sure each new addition worked before proceeding. We decided early on to use buttons for choices, and put a class on some buttons in order to create a loop to look for a click on those, with the purpose to be able to proceed to the next question after any of them was selected.

We have a function that makes sure that the chatbot continues on to the next question when called, and another function that adds a chat bubble in the right place depending on if it's the bot or the user who is saying something. We have also added a few global variables.

During our entire pair programming we've made sure to look for problems in the terminal, in order to fix everything before testing.
We have worked with functions, variables, eventlisteners and also looping. We have asked for help on StackOverflow when needed and have received some really good advice and feedback from our classmates.

We discussed to possibly use if and else and calculate the price for the tickets depending on the amount of tickets the user chooses, so that could be something we'd do if we had more time. For now we decided that the approach we have used works well considering the content. We would also like to extend our knowledge on how to use looping the best way, since we was really helped by using it for our chatbot, but need to know more in order to use it in any context.
